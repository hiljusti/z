/**
 * WARNING!! You are using evil code.
 *
 * In the battle between good and evil, always strive for a heroic path. All
 * code marked as @Evil is evil. It can destroy your assumptions and run amok
 * in ways that are hard to anticipate.
 *
 * There are only two reasons to use Evil code:
 *
 * <ol>
 *  <li>You are also evil and have embraced chaos over order</li>
 *  <li>You are pure enough to see the potential for good, and will help the evil
 *      code stay on a straight and narrow path</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * Evil can be controlled by the strong and brave. With enough grace, mercy,
 * and determination, you might even be able to completely tame evil code.
 * You may even make it a redeemed companion... But remember that redemption
 * comes at a cost.
 *
 * If you're attempting to control evil, you might need to explain how you're
 * doing it.
 *
 * If you're reviewing code that uses evil code, it's a code smell and it's
 * reasonable to ask for explanations.
 *
 * Categories of evil:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Functions with many arguments:</b> The heroic path will use a complex object.</li>
 *   <li><b>Function continuations with many arguments:</b> The heroic path will use a complex object.</li>
 *   <li><b>Disguising side-effects:</b> The heroic path will create better abstractions. This is very hard.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * TODO: Give examples and reasoning on the above points

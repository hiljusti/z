## Evil

Some code may need to be evil, and if so, should be marked with `@Evil`.

This is an example of a neutral combination:

```
Function<A, B> + Function <B, C> = Function<A, C>
```

Assuming both functions are pure, it has a clear flow and nothing is hidden.

This, on the other hand, is an example of an _**evil**_ combination:

```
Consumer<A> + Supplier<B> = Function<A, B>
```

There is no direct relation between the void return of the Consumer and the no-args invocation of the Supplier. This can usually be understood as a code smell. Something is being done in that Consumer (a network call, something in a thread, a mutating action) that may now be hidden from the end caller.

Evil functions or collections of functions can be a sign of either

1. Evil code is being written, or
1. Code is interacting with something evil

## Ordering

Because alphabetic ordering may be difficult to grok, the project follows the
following ordering. Classes may be omitted when there is no benefit, or a
different class also matches, and there's no benefit to specificity.

1. BiFunction
1. DoubleFunction
1. DoubleToIntFunction
1. DoubleToLongFunction
1. ToDoubleFunction
1. ToDoubleBiFunction
1. IntFunction
1. IntToDoubleFunction
1. IntToLongFunction
1. ToIntFunction
1. ToIntBiFunction
1. LongFunction
1. LongToDoubleFunction
1. LongToIntFunction
1. ToLongFunction
1. ToLongBiFunction

### Predicate family

1. Predicate

### Consumer family

1. Consumer

# Testing

Examples in tests are encouraged.

Because of the complexity of generics and function signatures, and the simplicity of function implementations (many only a single line) compilation itself is often enough testing for me to be happy with the validity of code.

All PRs must continue to compile.

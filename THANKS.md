The following resources contributed to my thinking about some of this madness:

1. Functional languages, especially Haskell and Erlang
    - These books helped me start out learning those languages:
        - https://learnyouahaskell.com
        - https://learnyousomeerlang.com
    - Also, https://learnxinyminutes.com helped learning more broad language ideas
2. https://blackdoor.github.io/blog/algebraic-types/
3. https://docs.vavr.io/#_functions (I don't claim Z to be better or worse. Definitely different)
4. https://dragonball.fandom.com

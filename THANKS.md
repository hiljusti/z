The following resources contributed to my thinking about some of this madness:

1. Functional languages, especially Haskell and Erlang. These books helped me start learning those languages: https://learnyouahaskell.com and https://learnyousomeerlang.com
2. https://blackdoor.github.io/blog/algebraic-types/
3. https://docs.vavr.io/#_functions (I don't claim Z to be better or worse, just different)
4. https://dragonball.fandom.com
